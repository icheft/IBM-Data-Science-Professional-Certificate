# What Do Data Scientists Do?

Make predictions.

## Old Problems, New Problems, and Data Science Solutions
To discover optimal solutions for existing problems. 

+ Uber
    + Discover drivers available 
+ Toronto Transportation Commission
    + Peak hour clearances
    + most congested routes
+ Environment
    + bacterial blooms

### Get a better solutions 
1. Identify the problem and establish a clear understanding of it
2. Gather the data for analysis
3. Identify the right tools to use
4. Develop a data strategy

## Data Science Topics and Algorithms
+ regression
    The moment you sit in the cab, you see that there's a fixed amount there. It says $2.5.  
    Regression tells you what the base fare is and what is the relationshpi between time and the fare you have paid, and the distance you have traveled and the fare you've paid.
+ data visualization
+ artificial neural networks
+ nearest neighbor

> In any field, and data science is no different, a simple solution is always preferred over a complicated one, especially if the performance is comparable.

+ structure data
    + in rows and columns
    + tabular data
+ unstructured data
    + sometimes in video and audio formats
    + web log or web pages

## Cloud for Data Science 

Take your information and put it in the Cloud. Using Cloud enables us to gain instant access to open source technologies without the need for local configurations. It also ensures you the newest tools and libraries without maintaining them. 

Cloud is accessible from everywhere on any devices. 

+ IBM Cloud
    + Skills Network Labs, develop your own data science and bring up solutions
+ aws 
+ Google Cloud

## Summary
In this lesson, you have learned:

+ The typical work day for a Data Scientist varies depending on what type of project they are working on.
+ Many algorithms are used to bring out insights from data. 
+ Accessing algorithms, tools, and data through the Cloud enables Data Scientists to stay up-to-date and collaborate easily.
