# Deep Learning and Machine Learning
## Difference
+ Big Data
    + 5 V's: velocity, volume, variety, veracity, and value
+ Data Mining
    + preprocessing data -> transforming -> analyze
+ Machine Learning
    + Use computer algorithms to analyze data and make intelligent decisions based on what it has learned
    + trained with large sets of data 
    + they learn from examples
+ Deep Learning
    + a specialized subset of machine learning
    + use layered neural networks to simulate human decision-making
+ Neural Networks
    + a collection of small computing units, called neurons


**Deep learning** is part of a broader family of machine learning methods based on artificial neural networks with representation learning.  

**Machine learning** uses algorithms to parse data, learn from that data, and make informed decisions based on what it has learned achieving high prediction accuracy whereas **Deep learning** is an AI function that mimics the workings of the human brain in processing data for use in detecting objects, recognizing speech, translating languages, and making decisions. 

Thereby, in analyzing house budget , machine learning algorithms are considered rather than deep learning.



### AI vs. Data Science
+ Data Science
    + is the process and method for extracting knowledge and insighs from large volumes of disparate data
    + It involves mathematics statistical analysis data visualization machine learning and more...
    + it could use machine learning algorithms or deep learning models to help facilitate analysis.
    + It's a broad term encompasses the entire data processing methodology
+ AI includes everything that allows computers to learn how to solve problems and make intelligent decisions

Both AI and Data Science can involve the use of Big Data.

AI ≠ Data Science

## Neural Networks and Deep Learning
Neural network is trying to use computer, a computer program that will mimic how neurons, how our brains use neurons to process thing.

Problems:  
+ computationally very intensive/expensive 

Deep Learning:

Neural networks on steroids. based on enormous amount of matrix and linear algebra calculations to actually do all of the mathematics that you need in neural networks. 

e.g. recognizing speech, recognizing people, images, classifying images → learn

Get started with neural networks:

+ Linear algebra
+ need to know how to do use linear algebra do transformations

## Applications of Machine Learning
+ Recommender systems
+ classifications
+ cluster analysis

+ Predictive analytics: using new techniques to predict things that statisticians don't particularly like

You have to understand the meanings of these techniques. 

### Recommendations
"Hey, you're a user, you've watched this show, so maybe you'd like to see this other show." 

Can project it to investment professional, from one investment idea to another. 

Can also apply it to fraud detection.



In this lesson, you have learned:

+ The differences between some common Data Science terms, including Deep Learning and Machine Learning.
+ Deep Learning is a type of Machine Learning that simulates human decision-making using neural networks.
+ Machine Learning has many applications, from recommender systems that provide relevant choices for customers on commercial websites, to detailed analysis of financial markets.
+ How to use regression to analyze data.
