# Big Data and Data Mining

## Foundations of Big Data
Everyone leaves a trace in this digital world. 

### Big Data
+ Velocity: the speed which data accumulate
+ Volume: the scale of the data
    + Increase in data sources
    + higher resolution sensors
    + scalable infrastructure
+ Variety: the diversity of the data - structured vs. unstructured
    + Data from different sources
    + Drivers
        + Mobile technologies
        + social media
        + wearable technologies
        + geo technologies
        + video
+ Veracity: facts and accuracy
    + attributes
        + consistency
        + completeness
        + integrity
        + ambiguity
    + drivers
        + cost 
        + need for traceability 
    + tools
        + hadoop
        + apache spark
+ Value: turn data into value
    + medical or social benefits

## What is Hadoop?
1. mapper process
2. reduce process

### Components of Data Science
+ Probability and Statistics
+ Algebra, Linear Algebra, Programming, databases
+ Machine Learning - taking large data sets

Instead of taking a sample and trying to test some hypotheses, we can take large data sets and look for patterns. 

Decision Sciences

## How Big Data is Driving Digital Transformation
NBA Houston Rockets use big data to find pattern and analysis for players.

## Summary
In this lesson, you have learned:

+ How Big Data is defined by the Vs: Velocity, Volume, Variety, Veracity, and Value.
+ How Hadoop and other tools, combined with distributed computing power,  are used to handle the demands of Big Data.  
+ What skills are required to analyse Big Data. 
+ About the process of Data Mining, and how it produces results.
