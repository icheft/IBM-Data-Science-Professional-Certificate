# Other IBM Tools
## Other IBM Tools for Data Science
+ Watson Knowledge Catalog: help data scientists to catalog and manage all their data resources
+ Data Refinery: graphical tools for analyzing and preparing data
+ Modeler Flows in Watson Studio
+ SPSS based products - IBM SPSS Statistics and IBM SPSS Modeler: include easy to use graphical interfaces for wide varieties of statistical and machine learnig algorithms and data transformations
+ Model Deployment strategies
+ AutoAI and Watson OpenScale


## IBM Watson Knowledge Catalog
Unite al information assets into a single metadata-rich catalog, based on Watson's understanding of relationships between assets and how they're being used and socialized among users in existing projects.

Features:

+ Find data
+ Catalog data
+ Govern data
+ Understand data
+ Power data science
+ Prepare data
+ Connect data
+ Deploy anywhere


## Data Refinery
*Simplifying Data Preparation*: 

+ Cleansing, Shaping, and Preparing data take up a lot of time
+ These tasks come in the way of the more enjoyable parts of Data Science: **analyzing data** and **building ML models**
+ Data sets are typically not readily consumable. They need to be refined and cleansed

## SPSS Modeler Flows in Watson Studio
+ Inspired by IBM SPSS Modeler

Build powerful machine learning pipeline

+ Auto-Classifier and Auto-Numeric
+ Auto AI - not only building a model but also an entire data pipeline

## IBM SPSS Modeler

+ originally named Clementine by Integral Solutions Limited

+ Data mining and text analytics software application
+ Leverage statistical and data mining algorithms without programming

## SPSS Statistics
+ Evolved from Statiscal Package for Social Science (SPSS), originally released in 1968.

## Model Deployment with Watson Machine Learning
### How to Deploy Models?
+ Workflow solutions
+ Open Standards

+ Use Open sources or commercial products

+ PMML - Predictive Model Markup Language
    + originated from The Data Mining Group
    + Standards based on XML
    + can be generated by Watson Studio and SPSS products
+ PFA - Portable Format for Analytics from DMG 
    + JSON based small programming language
+ ONNX - Open Neural Network eXchange
    + Created from neural networks

    
+ IBM Watson Machine Learning
    + Deploy models built with Watson Studio, SPSS Modeler, many open source Packages
    + Support for PMML and ONNX
    + Batch or online scoring

## Auto AI in Watson Studio

Still a shortage of qualified data scientists.

AI lifecycle management:

+ Raw labeled data set
+ Prep
+ Model selection
+ HPO
+ Feature Engineering
+ HPO


Example of using AutoAI - data
+ Columns
    + gender
    + Age
    + Martial status
    + profession
    + is_tent: the column to predict

+ Pipeline comparison

### Achieved
+ for classification and regression models
+ time series support will be available in the future

## IBM Watson OpenScale

+ helps to ensure fairness and explain-ability of machine learning pipelines, as well as monitored their performance after deployment

### OpenScale Features
+ Fairness: apply ways to overcome bias
+ Explainability: audit and explain model decisions
+ Model monitoring: detect model's deterioration
