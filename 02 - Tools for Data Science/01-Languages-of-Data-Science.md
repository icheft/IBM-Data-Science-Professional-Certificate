# Language of Data Science
## Course Introduction
Data science requires programming. 

+ Visual programming
+ Open source 
+ Commercial software - leverage open source software
+ Cloud computing 

## Languages of Data Science
+ python, R, SQL (recommended)
+ Scala, Java, C++, julia

It depends on what problems you need to solve. 

### Roles in Data Science
+ Business Analyst
+ Database Engineer
+ Data Analyst
+ Data Engineer
+ Data Scientist
+ Research Scientist
+ Software Engineer
+ Statistician
+ Product Manager
+ Project Manager

## Introduction to Python
### Who is python for?
+ People who already know how to program
+ People who want to learn to program
+ Over 80% of data professional worldwide
+ Python is used heavily in data science, AI, and machine learning, web development, and IoT 

It is a:

+ General purpose language 
+ Large standard library

### Python in Data Science
1. Scientific computing libraries like Pandas, Numpy, Scipy, and Matplotlib
2. For AI: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn
3. NLP: NLTK (some sort of toolkit)

## Introduction to R 
Learning up to three languages can increase your salary.

It is not open source like Python, rather it is a free software.

+ The Open Source Initiative (OSI) champions open source
    + business focused
    + open source software can be modified without sharing the modified source code depending on the open source license
+ the Free Software Foundation (FSF) defines free software
    + more focused on a set of values
    + Free software can always be run, studied, modified, and redistributed with or without changes
    + 

Easy to translate from math to code. It is popular in academia. It integrates well with other computer languages. And has stronger object-oriented programming facilities than most statistical computing languages. 

## Introduction to SQL
+ SQL = Structured Query Language

How it works:  
+ a non-procedural language
+ scope is limited to querying and managing data

+ it is developed at IBM

A combination of *clause*, *expressions*, *predicates*, *queries*, and *statements*.

### What makes SQL great
+ Knowing SQL willhelp you get jobs as a business and data analyst and is a must in data engineering and data sceince.
+ When performing operations with SQL the data is accessed directly (without any need to copy it beforehand). This can considerably speed up workflow executions.
+ SQL is the interpreter between you and the database
+ SQL is a ANSI standard, which means if you learn SQL and use it with one database you will be able to easily apply your SQL knowledge with many other databases

SQL databases available:  
+ MySQL
+ PostgreSQL
+ SQLite
+ Oracle
+ IBMDB2
+ MariaDB

## Other Languages
+ Scala
    + provides support for FP
    + extension to Java
    + Scalable Language
    + Apache Spark: designed to be faster than Hadoop
+ Java 
    + tried-and-true general-purpose OOP language
    + Hadoop - manages data processing and storage for big data applications running in clustered systems
+ C++ 
    + extension of C
    + develop programs that feed data to customers in real-time
    + TensorFlow
    + MongoDB - a NoSQL database for big data management
    + Caffe - a deep learning algorithm repository
+ julia
    + designed at MIT in 2012
    + speedy development like Python or R while producing programs that run as fast as C or Fortran programs would
    + Julia DB
+ JS
    + extends beyond the browser with Node.js and other serve side approaches
    + `TensorFlow.js`
    + `R-js`: makes linear algebra possible in Typescript
+ php
+ GO
+ Ruby
+ Visual Basic
