# From Problem to Approach

## Business Understanding
Sek clarification first. Getting clarity around th problem to be solved allows you to determine which data will be used to answer the core question.

1. What's the goal?
2. 


Q: What is the best way to allocate the limited healthcare budget to maximize is use in providing quality care?

Patient Readmission: patients with congestive heart failure were at the top of the readmission list.

1. Predict CHF readmission outcome (Y or N) for each patient
2. Predict the readmission risk for each patient
3. Understand explicitly what combination of events led to the predicted outcome for each patient
4. Easy to understand and apply to new patients to predict their readmission risk

## Analytic Approach

+ seeking for clarification 

What types of pattern will be needed to address the question most effectively?

**Machine Learning** 
+ Learning without being explicitly programmed
+ Identifies relationships and trends in data that might otherwise not be accessible or identified
+ Uses clustering association approaches

### Case Study
Instance -> Y or N outcome
