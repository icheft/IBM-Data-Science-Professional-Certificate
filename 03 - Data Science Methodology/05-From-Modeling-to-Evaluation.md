# From Modeling to Evaluation

## Modeling - Concepts
Sampling the food (the data). And whether or not to add more seasoning to the data.

+ Using predictive or descriptive
    + predictive: yield yes or no outcome - statistics driven or machine learning driven
+ using training / test sets
    + use different algorithms
+ understanding the question
    1. Understand the question at hand
    2. Select an analytic approach or method to solve the problem
    3. Obtain, understand, prepare, and model the data
+ End goal: the data model can be built to answer the question
    + "have i make enough to eat?"
    + making sure that the answer is clear and relevant



## Modeling - Case Study

### Analyzing the 1st model
Initial decision tree classification model
+ low accuracy on "yes" outcome

We need to improve the accuracy.

### How to Improve the Model?

### Analyzing the 2nd model
### Analyzing the 3rd model

Sensitivity (Y accuracy) vs Specificity (N accuracy)

## Evaluation

+ assess the quality of the model

Answering the question: does the model used really answer the initial question or does it need to be adjusted?

### 2 phases
+ Diagnostic measures
    + predictive model
    + descriptive model
+ Statistical Significance Testing

### Case Study - Applying the Concepts
#### Misclassification Costs
+ Misclassification cost tuning
    + tune the relative misclassification costs
    + Balance true-positive rate and false-positive rate for best model
+ Diagnostic tool for classification model evaluation
    + classification model performance
    + true-positive rate vs false-positive rate
    + optimal model at maximum separation

## Summary

In this lesson, you have learned:

+ The difference between descriptive and predictive models.
+ The role of training sets and test sets.
+ The importance of asking if the question has been answered.
+ Why diagnostic measures tools are needed.
+ The purpose of statistical significance tests.
+ That modeling and evaluation are iterative processes.
