# From Deployment to Feedback

## Deployment
> Making the answer relevant and useful to address the initial question involves getting the stakeholders familiar with the tool produced.

### Case Study 
#### Understand the Results
+ Assimilate knowledge for business
    + practical understanding of the meaning of model results
    + implications of model results for designing intervention actions

#### Gathering Application Requirements
+ Application requirements
    + automated, near-real-time risk assessments of CHF inpatients
    + easy to use
    + automated data preparation and scoring
    + up-to-date risk assessment to help clinicians target high-risk patients

#### Additional Requirements
+ training for clinical staff
+ tracking/monitoring process


## Feedback
> Feedback from the users will help to refine the model and assess it for performance and impact.

> The more you know, the more you want to know.

Once the model is evaluated and the data scientist is confident it will work, it is deployed and put to the ultimate test. 

+ actual real-time use in the field

### Case Study
#### Assessing model performance
+ define review process
    + to measure results of applying the risk model to the CHF patient population
    + track patients who received intervention
        + **actual readmission outcomes**
    + measure effectiveness of intervention
        + compare readmission rates before & after model implementation
#### Refinement
+ refine model
    + initial review after the first year of implementation
    + based on feedback data and knowledge gained
    + participation in intervention program
    + possibly incorporate detailed pharmaceutical data originally deferred
    + other possible refinements as yet unknown
+ Redeploy
    + continue modeling, deployment, feedback, and refinement throughout the life of the intervention program

+ feedback


## Lesson Summary

In this lesson, you have learned:    

+ The importance of stakeholder input.
+ To consider the scale of deployment.
+ The importance of incorporating feedback to refine the model.
+ The refined model must be redeployed.
+ This process should be repeated as often as necessary.
